-- Copied from esx_identity to support both Steam & Rockstar licensing
-- Changes the identifiers from Rockstar License To Steam. In order to use this, you will have to have
-- made edits to your ESX in order to use Steam identifiers all around, because new ESX uses Rockstar
-- license. I just made it easier for people that convert to steam identifiers.
